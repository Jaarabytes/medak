            Medical technology, or medtech, is integral to healthcare from
            birth, aiding diagnostics and treatment through innovations like
            plasters for minor injuries, glasses for vision correction, and
            advanced devices like stents and MRI scans for serious conditions.
            These technologies, developed and manufactured by medtech companies,
            are central to modern healthcare, revolutionizing disease detection,
            treatment, and monitoring. They enable less invasive procedures,
            ensure safer surgeries, and enhance overall patient care and
            productivity.

            Medical devices in Kenya, ranging from simple syringes, wheelchairs
            and bandages to cardiac pacemakers and advanced MRI machines, are
            classified by risk level and are integral in diagnosing, treating,
            and managing health conditions. Digital health solutions, part of
            this spectrum, harness information and communication technologies to
            enhance healthcare delivery, offering innovative ways for patient
            monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment optimization.

            In-vitro diagnostics, IVDs, are medical devices crucial for
            analyzing biological specimens like blood, urine, or tissues outside
            the human body, providing essential data for diagnosis and
            monitoring. These tests guide healthcare professionals and patients
            in making informed decisions, without having direct physical contact
            with individuals.

            molecular diagnostics for genetic analysis, haematology for blood
            conditions, microbiology for identifying pathogens, and
            point-of-care testing for immediate results. Additionally, they
            facilitate critical procedures like blood typing and cross-matching,
            ensuring safe blood transfusions.
